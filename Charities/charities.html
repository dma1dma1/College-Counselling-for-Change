                                    <p>
                                        In order to recognize the fact that there are many families that struggle on a 
                                        daily basis to put food on the table as well as pay rent, we are proud to 
                                        support the Brooklyn Community Foundation and its work to fight poverty and 
                                        inequality. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While being the largest and most populous borough in New York City, 
                                        Brooklyn is also home to much wealth disparity and racial inequality. As of 
                                        2019 the total population of Brooklyn was over two and a half million people 
                                        with about 19% of those residents living below the poverty line. To add onto 
                                        this, over three thousand residents of Brooklyn are imprisoned every year, 
                                        30% of renters spend more than half of their income on rent alone, and 
                                        Brooklyn ranks third in the state of New York for income inequality. Due 
                                        to issues like this, The Brooklyn Community Foundation has made it their 
                                        vision to create, “A fair and just Brooklyn, built on dignity and respect, 
                                        where all residents have the opportunity to participate and prosper.” 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In order to achieve this goal and help those most in need, the Brooklyn 
                                        Community Foundation works with members of its own community as well as 
                                        local nonprofits in order to learn what to prioritize and how to make the 
                                        most of their platform and donations. With 70% of Brooklynites being people 
                                        of color, this foundation understands the need to look at these issues 
                                        through a Racial Justice Lens in order to address systemic racial injustices 
                                        and not overlook the issues that are heavily affected by one’s skin color.

                                        When making your donation, you will have the option to donate to one of five funds: 
                                        the COVID-19 Response Fund, the Community Fund, the Immigrant Rights Fund, the Invest 
                                        in Youth Fund, and the Racial Equity Fund.

                                    <p>
                                        The Racial Equity Fund focuses on initiatives that are meant to help people of color 
                                        in Brooklyn determine their own sustainable future. Through the use of grantmaking, 
                                        advocacy, and professional development, this foundation looks to create justice for 
                                        the people of Brooklyn.
                                    </p>

                                        In the Invest in Youth initiative, the Brooklyn Community Foundation has donated over 
                                        $2.5 million dollars annually to nonprofits. The aim of this program is to promote 
                                        youth leadership and provide thousands of young people with the economic and 
                                        educational opportunities that they might not otherwise have. The Foundation works 
                                        to help the people of Brooklyn by working with local leaders to understand where the 
                                        needs are and the resources needed to address them. By managing their resources 
                                        effectively they have built their asset base and established relationships with 
                                        experts in order to innovate, build on current projects and sustain their amazing work.

                                        The COVID-19 Response Fund and Immigrant Rights Fund also seek to address systemic 
                                        challenges against marginalized groups across New York City, and the Community Fund 
                                        is a flexible fund to address all of the initiatives undertaken by the Brooklyn Community 
                                        Foundation.

                                        Long Island is amongst the 10 most racially segregated metropolitan areas in 
                                        the United States, impacting housing, schooling, and diversity. During the 
                                        mid-20th century, policies were put in place to ensure that mass-scale 
                                        affordable housing was for white potential residents only. ERASE Racism has 
                                        filed multiple civil rights complaints regarding violations made in the 
                                        Affirmatively Further Fair Housing (AFFH). The AFFH is a part of the Fair 
                                        Housing Act (FHA). It is intended to prevent discrimination and reverse 
                                        preexisting segregation on the island.

                                        Racial disparities in school discipline interferes with students ability to 
                                        learn and negatively impact their relationship and outlook on education. In 
                                        2019, a study found that Black students are 3x more likely to be suspended or 
                                        expelled when compared to their white counterparts. In conjunction with this, 
                                        Black students are more likely to be removed from classrooms for subjective 
                                        offenses. These statistics indicate an implicit bias on educators parts, which 
                                        ERASE Racism tries to prevent or stop. In the education system, ERASE Racism 
                                        promotes integration, advocating for benefits of learning environment diversity, 
                                        diversity-based curriculum topics, outreach to diverse students, and the 
                                        recruitment and retainment of teachers of color.

                                        ERASE Racism’s Partnership for Racial Equity is a collective of individuals dedicated 
                                        to educating themselves and others about policies and impacts of structural racism. 
                                        They hold events and forums on LI to begin dialogues about and discuss action items 
                                        against racial discrimination.

                                        ERASE Racism intends on attacking issues in housing and education by spearheading public 
                                        policy advocacy and other initiatives to promote racial equity on Long Island. Along 
                                        with this, they participate in a wide variety of research projects, to educate and 
                                        consult in activities that address structural and institutionalized racism. We have 
                                        chosen to support ERASE Racism in order to aid in their goal of changing communities 
                                        so that no person’s available opportunities are inhibited by their race or ethnicity. 
                                        In past years, the Three Village Central School District has had several students who 
                                        serve as part of ERASE Racism’s student ambassadors.

                                    <h5>Why this cause is important to us</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Many public schools around the country are underfunded, especially in marginalized 
                                        and impoverished communities. These schools are unable to support their students 
                                        fully, which leads students to drop out. Low-income students are less likely 
                                        to graduate high school. In 2017, students in low-income families dropped out of 
                                        high school at twice the rate of students in higher-income families. This 
                                        education crisis in low-income communities intersects with the struggle for 
                                        racial equality, as children of color are more than two times as likely as white 
                                        children to be born into poverty. Students of color perform far worse on the NAEP 
                                        assessment (known colloquially as “The Nation’s Report Card”) than their white 
                                        counterparts. In the reading section of the NAEP, Black and Hispanic students’ 
                                        average scores were 25 points below the scores of their white classmates. This 
                                        difference is the equivalence of about two grade levels. The disparity in access 
                                        to quality education has long-lasting impacts on the opportunities later in life 
                                        that these children will encounter. Teach For America refers to this disparity as 
                                        the “opportunity gap.” We have chosen to support Teach For America because its 
                                        mission is to close the opportunity gap in U.S. public schools, by providing the 
                                        resources and opportunities for all students to succeed.

                                        The way TFA aims to do this is by recruiting and training adults to educate 
                                        students in public schools for two years. The TFA philosophy is that there is 
                                        potential in every child, and they seek out people that fundamentally believe 
                                        in this principle. They currently have 6,190 members teaching 355,500 students 
                                        in all grade levels and subject areas. After serving, these teachers join the 
                                        TFA alumni network and continue to support TFA’s mission in their future careers. 
                                        TFA creates job opportunities for these marginalized groups. Half of the people in 
                                        the TFA corps identify as people of color, and half come from low-income backgrounds. 
                                        Furthermore, more than 1,000 current TFA corps members had been taught by TFA 
                                        teachers when they were students. TFA teaches educators to be cognizant of the 
                                        obstacles that low-income students and students of color face.
